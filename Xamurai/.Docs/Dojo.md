# Dojo Challenge #1

**Paged Collection View**

## Instructionsï»¿

Implement a collection view for a collection of cars (see some of the Experiments pages)

- Use the /Challenges/PagedCollectionPage.xaml for your implementation
- Implement carousel paging for a 2-column page, but where each element stacks like in the FlexLayoutPage example
- Use the CarView as the item template
- No rules for how you achieve this (there is no single right answer):

For Example, you can choose to use a Carousel View that contains flex layouts by splitting the collection,	or by implementing a snap behavior for a flex layout that scrolls to the next 2 columns on swipe.

- Target Android as primary platform
- Feel free to add / remove / upgrade / downgrade nuget packages to help you with your task
- Recommendation is not to spend more than 4 - 5 hours on this task. If incomplete, just add some notes as to your intent for what you did do.

#### Stretch Goals

- The implementation should cater for template resizing (tap the circle to collapse the template)
- Implement in iOS as well
